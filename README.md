# Selenium+TestNG
Automated websites by invoking browser using Selenium WebDriver. Got hands on experience in locators, synchronization methods(i.e.Sleep, Implicit Wait, Explicit Wait), handling Static and Dynamic Dropdowns by scripting. Used asertion methods from TestNG framework to validate the results in different scenarios i.e. functionaliies, UI performance etc.
